GOSI is an acronym for General Organization of Social Insurance. As per the law of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the worker inside the kingdom must be registered in GOSI. Each month there is an amount to be paid to General Organization of Social Insurance authority based on the sum of the basic salary and the housing allowance; all other allowances are not included. <br>
For Saudi Nationals, 22% of the monthly salary (basic + housing allowance) has to be paid to GOSI; as for non-Saudis, 2% has to be paid for GOSI which is shouldered by the employer. The 2% paid for the expats are for the injuries related to workplace. When employees get injured during or due to work, their salary and the expenses of treatment during this period are paid by GOSI until they recover and get back to work. <br>
For Saudi employees, the same 2% is paid and for the same reason. The remaining 20% for Saudis are split to 10% for pensioners when it is due, and 10 % for the unemployment aids. The employee shoulders 10% and the employer shoulders 10% in addition to 2% for the work related injuries.
